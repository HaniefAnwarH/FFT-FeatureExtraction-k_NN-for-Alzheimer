1. Data Preparation
The code first loads three EEG datasets from CSV files. Each dataset represents a comparison between two groups (e.g., MCIvsHCFourier.csv). It then separates the data into features (EEG measurements) and labels (patient groups) and normalizes the features to prepare them for the models.

3. Model Comparison and Tuning
The core of the project is to evaluate and find the best parameters for three different classifiers:

-Logistic Regression with Lasso Regularization: A linear model that also performs feature selection by shrinking less important features to zero. It uses GridSearchCV to find the best regularization strength (C).

-Random Forest Classifier: An ensemble model that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy. It uses RandomizedSearchCV to efficiently search a wide range of hyperparameters, such as the number of trees and tree depth.

-K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A simple non-parametric model that classifies data based on the majority class of its nearest neighbors. It uses GridSearchCV to test different numbers of neighbors (K) and distance metrics.

3. Evaluation and Results
After finding the best model for each type, the code evaluates their performance on a held-out test set to get an unbiased measure of accuracy. It generates and displays key performance metrics and visualizations for each model:

-ROC Curve: To show the model's ability to discriminate between classes.

-Confusion Matrix: To provide a detailed breakdown of correct and incorrect predictions.

-AUC (Area Under the Curve) and Accuracy: To give a simple summary of the model's performance.

In summary, this project uses standard machine learning practices to build, tune, and compare classifiers on medical (EEG) data to address a specific diagnostic problem.
